# CSI1430-Tetris
Final Project for Spring CSI1430, Tetris *plays type-a*
https://classnotes.ecs.baylor.edu/wiki/CSI_1430_Spring_2023_Group_Project

## What is this?
This Git Repo contains the blood sweat and tears of people who don't really know what they are doing creating Tetris using the SDL plotter.

## What is Git?
Git is a code storage "standard" that works on **branches**.
You think think of it through this analogy:
I want to work on a specific aspect of the code, so I copy the entire project into a new folder, work on the code, and remerge it back into the main folder.
Imagine doing this, but with perfect version history, decriptions of the changes you made, and automatic merging. That's what Git is for. It's way better for code-collaboration than Google Drive or Box.

## How do I use GitHub?
GitHub is setup very generally so that you can use your own workflow, but to keep it consistant,
we will use GitHub's Workflow (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) for this project.
Any questions? Email me (Reese_ford1@baylor.edu), or message me on Teams. :)

## How do I open the code
Visual Studio: In the folder Visual Studio > Tetris_VS, open the Tetris_VS.sln file
Code Blocks: In the folder Code Blocks > Tetris_CB, open the Tetris_CB.cbp file
XCode: In the folder XCODE > Tetris_XC, open the Tetris_XC.xcodeproj file

## How do I create source code
Create the file in the !Source Code Folder either by creating a text document and renaming it (make sure to rename the extension), or, using your IDE of choice, make the file, but be sure it creates the file in !Source Code

## There is a file in !Source Code that my IDE is not aware of. Help!
Visual Studio: Right Click the folder the file belongs in (CPP Files or Header Files)
